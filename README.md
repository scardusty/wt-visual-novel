# World Trigger Visual Novel

Note: A lot of files/folders are missing in the online repository because they either contain spoilers or media assets. 

WTVN is a World Trigger-inspired visual novel that takes you into the world of World Trigger where you can be a Border agent. You can build your skills, make friends with existing characters, and maybe even join a squad! (You might also find love!)

WTVN is made with Ren'Py and Python. All of the game art, GUI, and coding is done by me.
